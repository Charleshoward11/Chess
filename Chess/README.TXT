ASSESSMENT
    I was able to do much of what I set out to do in this project, although not all.

MUST
Play chess with an easy-to-use interface.
    I was able to do all of this. The program allows you to play a full game of chess.
    It even predicts check, checkmate, and stalemate on the fly. I think that's all pretty impressive.

SHOULD
Play multiplayer, locally or over a network
    I was able to get the local multiplayer working, at least. I simply never had the time to try to implement
    networked multiplayer functionality.

COULD
Play single player, with a (basic) AI player
    From the very beginning, I knew that making a Chess AI would prove difficult.

WON'T
Break basic rules of chess
    The program does not allow you to move into check, and you can't castle if you shouldn't be able to.
    Somewhat humorously, it actually crashes entirely if you somehow manage to capture one of the Kings.
    That's not actually a problem, though; you can't do it. It's completely impossible to do that in chess.
    
NOTE: I plan on working on this until the day of the presentation, so it's entirely possible that this version of the project is outdated.

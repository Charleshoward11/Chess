The program crashes if a King gets captured, but that's actually perfectly acceptable.

To avoid making one of the Rook's ordinary moves unavailable,
the player should only be able to castle by dragging the King.


THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE CASTLING. IT THINKS THE PIECES STAY IN THEIR SPOTS. ALSO, A NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION.
